      Your body is a ham sandwich…

  Neglect the bed and then you might not feel like doing the dirty dishes, skip work and skip the gym. Before long, the snowball effect has become a filthy black puddle of melted water all over your life. One bad habit leads to the next, and—follow that path too far—even becomes crippling depression.

  On the flipside, make your bed in the morning and you have accomplished one thing. That motivates you to bang out 20 push-ups. Then to shower, make breakfast and do more productive things. Produce and create consistently and you’re almost guaranteed to create a notable life.
  Who told you it’s boring?
  In my 20s, I made it my mission to have no mission. I looked at people who repeated the same habits as dull, lifeless, on the borderline of dementia, even. Mindless automatons. I wanted to live a wild adventure, spontaneously, staying out and getting up when I pleased. Those people who lived the same lives every day? Not for me, thanks very much.
  Living with that mindset eventually led me into predictable emotions: angry about my lack of success, frustrated because I didn’t know what to do with my life, and clinically depressed because I was destroying my brain chemistry with “Spontaneous and Fun!” drinking, irregular sleep habits, and a bachelor’s diet of sandwiches and meat and potatoes. I felt less like Richard Branson and more like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day.
